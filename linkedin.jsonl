In Australia, there's a very strong connection between regenerative practice, circularity and the way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People think about Country. We must continue to care for Country. We can't keep depleting Country.\nWhen we talk about architecture, we often associate it with new buildings, like our project Atlassian Central. But new buildings actually account for only two to 3% of all buildings on the planet. The rest are existing buildings.\nIn Europe, most architecture projects are upcycling buildings or adaptive reuse. In very old cities, knocking things down is not considered. We tend to think, everything that has come before us can be knocked down. Or the cheapest option is to knock it down and start over again.\nWe must look at the bigger picture, and turn our eyes to existing buildings with as much gusto as we put into new buildings. Look at how we can reclaim, upcycle, and reinvent existing buildings.\nA great example is Quay Quarter Tower in Circular Quay, designed by 3XN and developed in partnership with BVN. The tower is 50 stories high and grafts onto an existing tower, which is one of the most complicated adaptive reuse projects in the world. By upcycling the original structure, we've saved 7.3 million kilos of carbon, as it already constitutes about 30% of the entire building.\nAnother example is Queen and Collins in Melbourne. The project is regenerative at a precinct level, including three incredible heritage buildings, a 40-storey tower from the early 90s and surrounding laneways and camp alleys.\nIf you can save an existing structure, there's already 80% of the carbon banked in. It's important that we can save it, change how the building works, and bring it back to life. This is how we can reduce carbon emissions and achieve regenerative practice.\nWhat we really need is the construction community and clients to come on board. We're at the front end of the problem. We need the whole ecosystem to buy into the concept to make it a reality. That's one of the complicated things about the construction industry and why their carbon emissions are so great.

The real opportunity lies in existing buildings.\nIn Europe, upcycling and adaptive reuse are common. In older cities, demolition isn't the default. Yet elsewhere, we often view tearing down as the easiest or cheapest solution.\nWe need to approach existing buildings with the same passion we reserve for new projects. By reclaiming, upcycling, and reinventing these structures, we can dramatically reduce carbon emissions.\nFor instance, saving an existing structure means 80% of the carbon is already embedded in the building. This is a crucial step in achieving regenerative practice.\nA great example is the Quay Quarter Tower, a 50-storey adaptive reuse project in Circular Quay. By upcycling the original tower, 7.3 million kilos of carbon were saved—around 30% of the building’s total carbon.\nThe key challenge?

In Australia, there's a very strong connection between regenerative practice, circularity and the way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People think about Country. We must continue to care for Country. We can't keep depleting Country.\nWhen we talk about architecture, we often associate it with new buildings, like our project Atlassian Central. But new buildings actually account for only two to 3% of all buildings on the planet. The rest are existing buildings.\nIn Europe, most architecture projects are upcycling buildings or adaptive reuse. In very old cities, knocking things down is not considered. We tend to think, everything that has come before us can be knocked down. Or the cheapest option is to knock it down and start over again.\nWe must look at the bigger picture, and turn our eyes to existing buildings with as much gusto as we put into new buildings. Look at how we can reclaim, upcycle, and reinvent existing buildings.\nA great example is Quay Quarter Tower in Circular Quay, designed by 3XN and developed in partnership with BVN. The tower is 50 stories high and grafts onto an existing tower, which is one of the most complicated adaptive reuse projects in the world. By upcycling the original structure, we've saved 7.3 million kilos of carbon, as it already constitutes about 30% of the entire building.\nAnother example is Queen and Collins in Melbourne. The project is regenerative at a precinct level, including three incredible heritage buildings, a 40-storey tower from the early 90s and surrounding laneways and camp alleys.\nIf you can save an existing structure, there's already 80% of the carbon banked in. It's important that we can save it, change how the building works, and bring it back to life. This is how we can reduce carbon emissions and achieve regenerative practice.\nWhat we really need is the construction community and clients to come on board. We're at the front end of the problem. We need the whole ecosystem to buy into the concept to make it a reality. That's one of the complicated things about the construction industry and why their carbon emissions are so great.

The real opportunity lies in existing buildings.\nIn Europe, upcycling and adaptive reuse are common. In older cities, demolition isn't the default. Yet elsewhere, we often view tearing down as the easiest or cheapest solution.\nWe need to approach existing buildings with the same passion we reserve for new projects. By reclaiming, upcycling, and reinventing these structures, we can dramatically reduce carbon emissions.\nFor instance, saving an existing structure means 80% of the carbon is already embedded in the building. This is a crucial step in achieving regenerative practice.\nA great example is the Quay Quarter Tower, a 50-storey adaptive reuse project in Circular Quay. By upcycling the original tower, 7.3 million kilos of carbon were saved—around 30% of the building’s total carbon.\nThe key challenge?

This is where we emotionally connect with the individual. For example, if we're discussing home care products, we might highlight how using sustainable products can save money or improve your health.\nThen we delve into the ‘we’ element. This is about impacts at the community level, like the benefits we can all enjoy when everyone in a suburb or neighbourhood adopts sustainable practices.\nFinally, we move to the level of ‘us.’ Here we consider impacts at a global scale. This is where we might talk directly about tackling climate change.\nIt’s tempting to jump straight to the third level and forget to think about the individual. But if we go back and look for those personal, emotional motivations for action, we can find so many more interesting and inspiring stories to tell.\nFor some people, fear will be inspiring, but it can discourage others. Striking the right balance is essential. You can use social media to test out different messages and gauge people’s responses.\nA good story is told in measured ways. It connects with the individual (me), considers their social context (we), and highlights the broader impact (us). Most of all, it’s real and authentic stories that will inspire effective and sustainable behavior change."}]},{"role":"model","parts": [{"text":"How can we inspire sustainable behavioural change?\nIn our Circular Sydney series, @Claire Maloney of @The Bravery reveals powerful storytelling strategies that drive real change.\nThe Bravery uses a ‘me, we, us’ framework to guide storytelling.\nFirst, we connect emotionally with the individual (‘me’), highlighting personal benefits, like saving money or improving health with sustainable products.\nNext, we address community impacts (‘we’), showing the collective benefits of widespread sustainable practices.\nFinally, we scale up to the global level (‘us’), focusing on how these changes contribute to fighting climate change.\nClaire remarks, “A good story is told in measured ways.

In fact, we are completely dependent on interconnection. We need funding to roll out our programs, but we also need to connect people to the notion of feeding vulnerable people. The best way for us to do that is through partnerships and engagement.\nWoolworths is one of our major partners. They give us funding, and we support them in their goal to achieve zero waste, making sure their surplus stock is rescued and delivered to people in need.\nWe also offer workplace team building opportunities, in the form of cooking classes. In the last two weeks, we’ve had 200 different corporate organisations engaged in the Cooking for a Cause program. Each class gives us a chance to share our message: we are all responsible for reducing food waste.\nWe live in a society that has become centred around the ‘me’ economy.
