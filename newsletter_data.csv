"Headline: Building human connection
Sub-headline: 85% sales growth starts with one simple factor.
This week’s Grow with ReCo mini masterclass we are talking about a simple, yet complex
topic: human connections.
In 1942, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite Boy in their ads, a personified character to help inject
human connection and build memory association. A sparkling personality that resembled
Coca-Cola’s bubbles, he had a mission to connect their customers with the brand’s
nickname, ‘Coke’.
For many years to come, the Sprite Boy image became a positive association, imprinted in
people's memories, while ‘Coke’ became widely recognised around the world, thanks to
Sprite Boy.

The human face
In 2024, the digital world hasn’t changed: the human face is still the biggest connector for
brands. It’s ubiquitous. Even social media algorithms favour it!
Why?
It doesn’t matter what era we are in. We are human. And we always crave for deep human
connection.
Studies show that brands with strong emotional connections with their customers could
outperform competitors by a staggering 85% in sales growth (source: gallup.com).
Building deep human connection with your audience can bring a powerful impact to your
business success.

How do you do this? How do you scale?
How Lush built deep human connection
Lush, known for its colourful bath bombs, doesn’t shy away from taking a stand for what they
believe in. In 2017, when Australia legalised same-sex marriage, Lush faced some criticism
for their vocal support of LGBTQIA+ rights.
But Lush prioritised its community over short-term profit. They continued to champion
equality through campaigns and support for LGBTQIA+ organisations. It resonated with
many customers.
Despite the backlash, Lush experienced a 30% sales increase that month.
They supported their customers in a deep, meaningful way. Their authenticity attracted
customers who shared their values, building a stronger community around the brand.

3 things to do this week
We're not asking you to advocate for a cause, but simply, understand your customer values
and connect with them on a deeper level, just like Lush did.

3 Mindful Minutes
Mindfulness creates space for clarity. Take a deep breath in, let all the air out of your mouth.
Repeat for 3 minutes.
Imagine standing face to face with your favourite customer. Look into their eyes. Ask
yourself:
What value am I adding to their lives?

1. Listen to your customers, deeply
Deep listening is the most important action we can take as small business owners. Your
customer feedback not only helps you build a deeper connection, but also gives you insights
on how you can improve your products and services - and communication.
3 questions for you:
● Do I know my customers at all? Do I talk to them?
● Do I listen to customer feedback?
● Do I implement changes based on customer feedback?

2. Build trust
Like any good relationship, trust is built through consistency, honesty and transparency. It
takes time.
3 questions for you:
● Are my actions aligned with my promises?
● Do I share clear information and address customers' concerns?
● Do I showcase positive customer experiences?

3. Sharing and acting on your values
Why do you do what you do? Your purpose and values should be shouted from the rooftops.
If you embrace them, your customers and employees will feel it too.
Storytelling is a powerful tool for sharing your values. Tell your stories, why you do things,
how you do it, what you stand for. But remember, walk to talk. That's the key to building a
powerful brand.
3 questions for you:
● Do I clearly define the values that drive my business?
● Do I integrate my values into all aspects of my business?
● Do I have a compelling story that showcases my values in action?

Do these first, and we’ll discuss how you can scale your impact and growth in next week’s
newsletter.

"Understanding human needs

The iPhone transformed the way we communicate. It took a simple calling device to become
a computer in our pockets - a necessity in modern lives. Today, the iPhone is still at the
forefront of technology, and a desirable device for many.
But what makes the iPhone so powerful?
This week’s Grow with ReCo mini masterclass dives deep into the fundamental key to
success for any business: meeting human needs.
Maslow's Hierarchy: A framework for understanding your
customers
Maslow's Hierarchy categorises human needs in a pyramid structure. The foundation is the
basic needs, and on top are more complex needs. We can use the framework to understand
your customers.
What makes the iPhone powerful is that it checks off every level of the pyramid, meeting
their customers’ needs:

1. Physiological: This level focuses on survival needs like food, water, and shelter. In
Apple's case, the iPhone, as a phone, meets the basic need for communication
between people.
2. Safety: People seek security and protection from threats. This can include financial
stability, physical safety and well-being. Security features like Face ID and Touch ID
contribute to the iPhone's reputation for reliability and create a sense of safety for
users.
3. Love and belonging: Humans crave connection and a sense of community. You
know the feeling of being an 'Apple' person or an 'Android' person? Well, that's the
blue messaging that lights up every time another Apple person messages you, you
know they're a kindred spirit.

4. Self esteem: People desire recognition, respect and a sense of accomplishment.
The iPhone capitalises on the psychological concept of 'symbolic self-completion',
where people define themselves, partially, by things they have and display. Apple
makes the iPhones feel special, with a higher price tag, sleek design and ongoing
marketing that shouts creativity and exclusivity.
5. Self actualisation: This highest level focuses on personal growth and fulfilment.
The iPhone is only a tool, but Apple inspires users to explore new ideas. It
showcases what can be achieved with the iPhone camera from creators all over the
world. It helps users achieve their own creative journey and express themselves
authentically - that's the brand's superpower.

Does my small business need to meet all human needs?
No, not all needs in Maslow's Hierarchy necessarily need to be fully met by a single
business.
However, by identifying your customers' needs across these different levels, you can reach
the full potential of your marketing efforts, including:
● Target the right audience: Knowing which need levels your business primarily
addresses helps you target the right audience.
● Be more competitive: If your business can meet multiple needs, it creates a
competitive advantage.
● Build brand loyalty: Mastering the full range of human needs, businesses can
create a more holistic customer experience and recurring customer base.

How to apply Maslow's Hierarchy framework?

3 Mindful Minutes
Mindfulness creates space for clarity. Take a deep breath in, let all the air out of your mouth.
Repeat for 3 minutes.
Imagine standing face to face with your top 10 favourite customers. Look into their eyes. Ask
yourself:
What are their needs? Which Maslow's hierarchy of needs does my business meet?

Apply the framework
1. Physiological: Focus on the core function your product or service provides. This
need is non-negotiable. So ask, how does my business serve my customers’ basic
needs?
2. Safety: The first step in fostering connection with people is to make them feel safe.
Create an environment that your customers feel they can trust you, and they have
peace of mind using your products and service.
3. Love & belonging: This could be simply how you genuinely care about your
customers in their customer experience. Online community, loyalty programs and
events are great ways to foster a sense of community around your brand value.
4. Self esteem: How does my business make my customers feel seen, heard or
known? For example, reward your customers, or create opportunities for them to
share their achievements related to your brand.
5. Self actualisation: Inspiration comes from stories that connect with your customers
on a deeper level. It can be your own story, your customers’ stories, your vision and
beliefs. Tell those stories genuinely, amplify your values, inspire your customers in
their own growth journey.

Put yourself in your customers’ position. Talk to your customers. Make a list. Write down how
your business can meet their needs.
This reinforces the foundation for all your marketing activities. We’ll use your list and dive
into crafting powerful messages that grow your business later."
"Lessons from Bunnings
Sub-heading: Who are your ideal customers?
Ever stood in line at Bunnings on a sunny Saturday morning, the scent of sizzling sausages
filling the air, a home improvement project half-formed in your mind?
This is a masterclass in customer understanding by Bunnings Warehouse. They go far
beyond hammers and paint because they know who their customers truly are. Since 1886,
the two Perth-based brothers have gone from saw-milling to Australia and New Zealand's
most iconic hardware store for families and tradies.
This week's Grow with ReCo mini masterclass discusses the most fundamental topic in
business: who are your ideal customers?
Bunnings know their customers
Bunnings’ customers are passionate about DIY projects and outdoor living. They are local
customers. They love their local communities. Many of them have kids. They love their
projects but most of them are also budget conscious.
Bunnings offers everything for home improvement projects, with their lowest prices policy
and knowledgeable, passionate staff. There are weekend sausage sizzles, local charity
support and DIY workshops. Pets are also welcome in their stores!
In 2024, Bunnings even transformed their stores for a collaboration with the iconic kids TV
show, Bluey. Stores were turned into the Hammerbarn, the hardware store in the show - a
classic weekend experience for Bluey's family.
All this customer-centric work has helped Bunnings cement its position as a household name
in Australia and New Zealand.

How to find your ideal customers
Bunnings' success hinges on their deep understanding of their core customer segments, and
the brand positioning around their needs and aspirations.
What's the most fascinating about Bunnings' customers:
● At a glance, they are mass market (of course, it's Bunnings)
● But when drilled down (pun intended), they focus on specific niches in specific
locations. They own those markets, and become the go-to place for customers in
those markets.

That we believe, is both a work of art and science that takes a long time to evolve and
perfect.
1. Defining who your ideal customers are
Many businesses start with a niche, but it can feel like a double-edged sword. Go too broad,
you get lost in the crowd. Go too narrow, you risk creating a market that's too small to
sustain your business.
From a business perspective, we always advise our clients to think:
● What problem does your product or service solve and how does it solve for?
● Who can pay for your products and services?
● Is the market big enough for you?
The key lies in finding the sweet spot: a niche that aligns with your unique offering and
vision, but with huge potential to grow - and pay for your values.
2. Discover your customer insights
If you've been running your business for a while, you should have some customer insights,
through 3 methods:
1. Data: This can be your sales data, customer data, social media analytics, website
analytics. Pool all that data to understand who they are, how much they spend with you,
what value do you bring to them.
This method is non-negotiable. It eliminates all the guesswork and focuses on the facts and
figures to inform your decision-making.
2. Your own understanding: This can be from your interactions with your customers and
your gut feelings. The more you experience with your customers, the better you know them,
and the more you can trust your own gut feelings.
3. Your team's insights: Value the opinions and suggestions from your customer service
and sales team. They are the people who are at the forefront dealing with your customers.
Their insights could become invaluable for your growth.
3. Analyse your insights
Analysis can be technical, but there is a high-level understanding that you can get from your
insights.
1. Look for trends and patterns.
2. Categorise your audience based on these patterns.
3. Look for the 'why' behind their actions to uncover their motivations and pain points.
The outcome of your analysis should serve the purpose of identifying who your ideal
customers are. But remember, people change, businesses change, markets change. So

you'll need to stay open and flexible, and review your strategy as you grow your business.
Adaptability is one of the best strategies you can adopt. It’s like Ross from friends said,
“PIVOT.”
4. Leave rooms for experiments
We don't know what we don't know. Wherever possible, you may want to test out different
ways to find missed opportunities. Here are 2 methods:
● Broad to niche: You can start with a broad category like 'people who are interested
in home goods'. Acquire those customers. Interact with them, understand them. You
can then narrow down these customers into different niche segments, and gain
insights on which segments should have your focus.
● Niche to broad: A good example is Sydney-based brand, Boody. They started as a
bamboo underwear brand, built a reputation around the eco-conscious crowds with
support from Dr. Jane Goodal being their ambassador. Today Boody's expanded to
bamboo clothing and is sold by many retailers including The Iconic.
Look out for more newsletters to come. We'll talk about how to build your audience personas
