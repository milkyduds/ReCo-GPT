How can we address the logistics challenges in Australia?
The logistics sector in Australia faces unique challenges due to its geography and demography. Manufacturing industries distribution networks span various states to cater to nationwide demands. Trucks and trains carry goods from these hubs, but often make return trips with empty or minimal loads. These resources are underutilised, but still contribute to carbon emissions.
A collaborative and customer-centric approach could solve some of these problems. By fostering open and transparent discussions, we could find solutions together.
For example, how do we solve the empty vehicles problem? Can we collaborate with companies who travel in opposite directions? We've done that in my work before. It reduces carbon emissions and costs, but also makes use of underused resources.
The sharing economy is also a great example. Services like Uber and Car Next Door match underused cars with people who need them. In the example of ReCo, it collaborates with consumers to reuse empty jars. It's a two-way street.
However, to fully address these challenges, we need a more efficient and sustainable network, and sustainable sources of fuel for heavy-goods vehicles. We're still a long way behind in terms of infrastructure development compared to some of our international peers.
