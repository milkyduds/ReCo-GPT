"        Systemic change, where do we start?

        In our Circular Sydney series, fearless changemaker, @Jess Scully, shares a bold vision for systemic change towards a circular economy.

        It's hard to change the system. The future feels vague—how do we define it? Whose future are we talking about? Is it next year, five years from now, or a century away? We also lack the tools, language and techniques to shape that future.

        In the past, society determined values through collective decisions, prioritising education, health and safety. But today, there’s a disconnect between what we truly value as humans and what the economy values.

        The first step toward a circular economy starts with conversations around values—what matters most to us. We need clear, inclusive discussions to understand what’s not working and explore alternative systems and processes. 

        Drawing from past lessons, especially from Indigenous cultures, can offer a roadmap for a more sustainable future.

        Governments must lead with regulations and sustainable infrastructure, while businesses and individuals support grassroots initiatives and create change within their communities.

        Together, we can galvanize change.

"        What are the barriers to making sustainable products? 
       
        In our Circular Sydney series, product designer @Nila Rezaei of @RK Collective shares practical insights on overcoming challenges in sustainable product design.
       
        The biggest hurdle? Getting people to take risks. Sustainability challenges the status quo—not just infrastructure but also our culture and the way we live. 
       
        Financial barriers play a major role. Sustainability requires substantial upfront investments, and while the impact is clear in the long run, it takes time to see those outcomes.
       
        The solution? A step-by-step approach. We can’t solve everything at once. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable problems, we can take calculated risks and make gradual improvements while keeping the bigger picture in sight. Each small step contributes to solving larger challenges over time.
       
        Everyone in the supply chain has a role to play. Manufacturers and brands must take responsibility, designers can make a significant impact early on, and consumers should educate themselves to make informed, conscious purchasing decisions."
"        The construction industry contributes 38-40% of global carbon emissions. Where are the opportunities for change?
       
        In our Circular Sydney series, architect @Ninotschka from @BVN shares a bold vision for regenerative design in construction.
       
        While architecture is often linked to new buildings—like Atlassian Central—these account for only 2-3% of all structures globally. The real opportunity lies in existing buildings.
       
        In Europe, upcycling and adaptive reuse are common. In older cities, demolition isn't the default. Yet elsewhere, we often view tearing down as the easiest or cheapest solution.  
       
        We need to approach existing buildings with the same passion we reserve for new projects. By reclaiming, upcycling, and reinventing these structures, we can dramatically reduce carbon emissions.
       
        For instance, saving an existing structure means 80% of the carbon is already embedded in the building. This is a crucial step in achieving regenerative practice.
       
        A great example is the Quay Quarter Tower, a 50-storey adaptive reuse project in Circular Quay. By upcycling the original tower, 7.3 million kilos of carbon were saved—around 30% of the building’s total carbon.
       
        The key challenge? Getting the construction industry and clients to embrace this vision. We need the entire ecosystem to support regenerative design to make real progress. It’s a complex issue, but one we must tackle together.

"        We live in a world where we can create anything at any time, but good things take time.” @Liane Rossler    

        In our Circular Sydney series, we chatted to artist, designer and curator, Liane Rossler about her approach to creativity and wisdom for long-term, sustainable growth. 

        “If you look to nature, you plant a seed, over time that seed grows into a big tree with a strong foundation. It’s important to create long-term strong growth with a healthy base.

        With my ceramics, what I love about it is the process itself. The clay comes from ‌Earth and you work it with your hands. It's an enriching, enjoyable and intentional process.

        If you want it to be stronger and live longer, you add heat to it. If you don’t like it, you put it back in the water and start again. It goes back to the ground. It’s zero waste. The whole process has a cycle of connection to the planet.

        The clays are sourced locally and directly from the supplier. They have different textures and characteristics in different states in Australia. By working with suppliers directly, we also support independent businesses.

        The outcome of the end product is to nurture life. Whether it’s to display food or plants that nourish us, the purpose of my ceramics is to provide benefits. They’re designed to be timeless and durable. I like to show the simplicity of the material and form. It's calming to the mind and complementary to the nature or food it’s presenting.

"        How can we build a sustainable ecosystem for circular economy businesses?

        In our Circular Sydney series, @Zolo Co-founder @Franz Siasat, shares insights to build his e-waste recycling start-up.

        “First and foremost, it's important to establish our values upfront, as a business and as individuals. When we have a clear set of values, we can identify how we can be a force for good collectively. As long as we stay true to our core, everything else will line up.

        We need more awareness and regulations on responsible e-waste disposal and recycling. Consider the tobacco control movement as an example. There's now a lot of force and urgency around anti-smoking. We set rules and regulations against it, and it works. We need a similar approach when it comes to addressing e-waste.

        Ultimately, we need to promote the benefits of circular economy practices. It's not only good for people and the planet, but also for businesses. ​​In our case, we resell the technology we refurbish and repair. We make money from it. Businesses are incentivised to dispose of the old tech in a sustainable manner, and recoup the funds to invest in new tech. The old tech finds new life and helps others pursue their dreams. It's win-win.

        There are many benefits to a circular economy, but we need to articulate it and advocate for it. We need policymakers, businesses and people to embrace it and build the ecosystem together.”

"        Can fashion really become sustainable?  
        
        In our Circular Sydney series, @Zoltan Csaki of @Citizen Wolf shares a bold vision for transforming fashion without greenwashing.  
        
        “Overproduction is the default model of the fashion industry. 30% of the clothing produced in the world is never worn and goes straight to landfill. Businesses have to work with minimum order quantities. You’re almost certainly guaranteed to be producing more than you can sell.” 
        
        “At Citizen Wolf, we make clothes on demand. It’s the best way to be environmentally conscious. And we've built the technology for custom-fit, so that customers get a better product and the best ecological and environmental outcomes.
        
        We send absolutely nothing to landfill, which not many fashion brands can say. Our t-shirts emit 48% less carbon than the equivalent fast fashion garment.” 
        
        Zoltan remarks, “The system fundamentally needs to change. We can’t keep on doing business as usual.”

"        How can we overcome financial challenges in achieving sustainability?
        
        In our Circular Sydney series, @Henri Turra of @Radish Events shares how their circular kitchen and event catering model evolved on the path to zero waste—and the financial realities behind it.
        
        “Wasted food equals lost profits, so reducing waste makes financial sense. But running a business sustainably is still more expensive overall. It takes time, energy, resources, and money to get things right, and the supply chain isn’t designed to support this model.”  
        
        “The business needs to be committed to making a change in order to stick with the more expensive running costs. The upside is that if you are able to translate this into value for your clients, you will also be able to price accordingly.” 
        
        The key is educating clients on the value of these practices. “When clients understand why we do what we do, they appreciate the difference—and are more willing to pay a little extra.”
        
        The shift is already happening. “More clients, especially corporates with ESG targets, are choosing us for our sustainable approach. While it’s not the majority yet, the momentum is building,”  
        
        Radish Events believes the future lies in collaboration. “The more businesses join us in driving change, the faster we’ll discover new solutions—and the easier sustainability will become for everyone.”

"        How can we tell stories to inspire positive change?

        In our Circular Sydney series, @Claire Maloney of @The Bravery reveals powerful storytelling strategies that drive real change.

        The Bravery uses a ‘me, we, us’ framework to guide storytelling.

        First, we connect emotionally with the individual (‘me’), highlighting personal benefits, like saving money or improving health with sustainable products.

        Next, we address community impacts (‘we’), showing the collective benefits of widespread sustainable practices.

        Finally, we scale up to the global level (‘us’), focusing on how these changes contribute to fighting climate change.

        Claire remarks, “A good story is told in measured ways. It connects with the individual (me), considers their social context (we), and highlights the broader impact (us). Most of all, it’s real and authentic stories that will inspire effective and sustainable behavior change.”

"        How can collaboration drive an organisation’s success?
        
        In our Circular Sydney series, @Ronni Kahn from @OzHarvest shares powerful insights into how collaboration aligns with their mission.

        “Collaboration is a huge part of what we do. In fact, we are completely dependent on interconnection. We need funding to roll out our programs, but we also need to connect people to the notion of feeding vulnerable people. The best way for us to do that is through partnerships and engagement.” 

        One example is their partnership with Woolworths. “They give us funding, and we support them in their goal to achieve zero waste, making sure their surplus stock is rescued and delivered to people in need.” 
        
        OzHarvest also offers team-building activities like Cooking for a Cause, where corporate teams learn to cook and reduce food waste. 
        
        Ronni remarks, “We live in a society that has become centred around the ‘me’ economy. We need to realise that what's good for us as individuals is only good if it's good for the planet and the people around us. The more we engage in circular economy activities, the better it is for our world.”"
